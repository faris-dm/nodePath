  in this exerises we learn the power of Node in accessing  the filesystem  means  it allow us to read files ,edit create and delite file simplily
   but mostly used  fiir building serverside application and Async oprations and  the program can continue reading while other  tasks are being performed


   Exerise 2
     reading the file in the  folder, but  what make it greate is that we used one 
     A: handled error
     B;data.substring(0,200)=> to specify  how man charcter  we need


     ==> we saw many things 
     1: about readFile,fs.readFileSync,appendFile,
     og(
  " the content of the file befor",
  fs.readFileSync("fs.txt", "utf-8")
);

console.log(" the content  of the file after chamge");

fs.appendFile("fs.txt", " this is new appens", (err) => {
  if (err) {
    console.log(err);
  } else {
    console.log("file cahnged to", fs.readFileSync("fs.txt", "utf-8"));
  }
});
::-  this  file show  how towrite and read  file in the console  as one opration


# 3: we  also saw how  to use const function is fs system and like fun
  cont file='fs.txt'
  const fun=(error,data)=> {
    if(error) throw error 
    console.log('"file",data.toString())
